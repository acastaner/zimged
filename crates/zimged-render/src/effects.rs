//! Effects shared by Annotation types: the drop shadow, and the machinery of effect Annotations
//! (highlight, obfuscate) that act on everything below them in z-order (§4.2).
//!
//! An effect Annotation's `draw` gets `below: &Scene` (the Image and the Annotations under it) and
//! the canvas, which at that point holds exactly `below` drawn. Two ways to act on it:
//! - pixel-wise effects (dim, grayscale, a multiplied colour) work on the canvas as it is:
//!   [`paint_over`], [`filter_below`];
//! - effects that move or mix pixels (magnify, pixelate, blur) re-render `below` offscreen over the
//!   region they read ([`render_below`]), so pixels outside the view (zoomed in) are still right
//!   and the screen matches Flatten.
//!
//! Both recompute on every composite, so the effect follows any change beneath it.
