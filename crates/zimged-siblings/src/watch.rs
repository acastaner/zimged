//! The directory watcher (§3.2): the `notify` crate watches the Image's directory, so the Sibling
//! list follows files added, deleted and renamed while zimged is open.
//!
//! Events are reduced to what the file system looks like *now*: for each file an event names, the
//! watcher's thread checks whether it exists and reports [`Change::Added`] or [`Change::Removed`].
//! That makes every event kind (create, delete, either half of a rename, a backend's "something
//! changed") the same two cases, and applying them is idempotent.
