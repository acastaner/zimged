//! Every string the UI shows or announces (§8.6): one table, English only.
//!
//! Widgets, messages and dialogs take their text from here; the only user-facing text elsewhere is
//! each tool's name and hint, which sit with the rest of its data in the `TOOLS` table
//! (`crate::tools`) so a new tool is one row. A fixed string is a `const`; text with a value in it
//! (a file name, a reason, a shortcut formatted for the platform) is a function. Accessibility
//! labels are the names screen readers announce and the headless tests find controls by, so
//! changing one is a visible change.
//!
//! Not here: error details from libraries (codecs, the OS) that messages pass through as the
//! `reason`, and the `config.toml` keys.
