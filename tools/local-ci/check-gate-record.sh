# zimged -- is there a gate record for this commit's tree? (#14, spec §9)
#
# Usage: ./tools/local-ci/check-gate-record.sh <commit-ish>
#
# Exits 0 when refs/notes/gate holds a note on <commit-ish>'s TREE whose first line starts with
# "PASS lint test" -- written by ./tools/local-ci/run.sh after a clean-room pass of all suites.
# Otherwise names the tree that lacks one and exits 1 (2 on a usage error).
#
# The note is on the tree, not the commit, so a --no-ff merge of a gated, up-to-date branch carries
# the branch's record. The release workflow's gate-record job (#41) runs this before building
# anything; locally, fetch the notes first if another machine ran the gate:
#   git fetch origin refs/notes/gate:refs/notes/gate
