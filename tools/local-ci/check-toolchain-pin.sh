# zimged -- the Rust toolchain pin preflight (#14, spec §9).
#
# Usage: ./tools/local-ci/check-toolchain-pin.sh [repo-root] [--rustc "<rustc --version output>"]
#
# The Rust version is pinned in rust-toolchain.toml (`channel`), the single source of truth: the
# gate image is built FROM rust:<channel> and installs exactly that toolchain. Two other places
# must agree with it, and this script fails (exit 1, naming the mismatch) when they do not:
#
#   - Cargo.toml's [workspace.package] rust-version, i.e. the same version without a patch level
#     (channel "1.95" or "1.95.3" both agree with rust-version "1.95");
#   - with --rustc, the compiler actually in use: "rustc 1.95.0 (...)" agrees with channel "1.95"
#     or "1.95.0", never "1.96" or "1.95.1".
#
# The channel must be an exact version (X.Y or X.Y.Z); "stable", "nightly" etc. float and are
# refused. On success it prints the channel, alone, on stdout. run.sh calls it first in every mode.
