# zimged -- the gate, run locally on this machine. There is no other: GitHub runs no tests.
#
# Usage: ./tools/local-ci/run.sh [suite ...] [options]
#
#   Suites (default, or `all`: both, in this order)
#     lint   cargo fmt --check; cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
#     test   the guard scripts' self-test; cargo test --workspace (the headless App tests and
#            the Sibling ordering comparator, spec §9)
#
#   Options
#     --in-place        run in the working tree with the host toolchain (fast iteration).
#                       NOT a gate result: no clean room, no gate record.
#     --cold            clean room only: delete the cargo cache volume before the run
#     --keep            clean room only: keep the run directory after a pass (it is always
#                       kept after a failure)
#     --no-clean        skip this run's leftover-container sweep on the way out
#     -h|--help         this text
#
# TWO MODES, ONE SCRIPT (a port of the clean-room local gate; see tools/local-ci/README.md).
#
#   Clean room (the default, and the only gate result). The launcher refuses a dirty working tree,
#   clones the committed HEAD into ~/.cache/zimged-gate/<run-id>/src, builds the gate image
#   (tools/local-ci/Dockerfile: Rust pinned by rust-toolchain.toml) and re-executes this script
#   inside it with ZIMGED_GATE_INSIDE=1. Nothing from the host leaks in -- no target/, no
#   ~/.cargo, no config -- and the working tree is never touched. After a pass of all suites the
#   launcher records it as a git note (refs/notes/gate) on the tested commit's TREE and pushes it;
#   the release workflow's gate-record job (#41) refuses a tree without one (check-gate-record.sh).
#
#   --in-place. The suites run here, in the working tree, with whatever toolchain rustup resolves
#   for rust-toolchain.toml. Useful while iterating; never a gate.
#
# ON DOCKER. Nothing here runs a `docker` command against anything it did not create. Every run has
# a run id; the gate container carries it as `zimged.run=<run-id>` (and `zimged.gate=<run-id>`, for
# the one-gate-at-a-time check), runs as the calling user (never root), and sees no host resource
# but its run directory and one unlabelled cache volume (zimged-gate-cargo: the crates.io registry,
# never build output). The tests start no containers, so the gate container gets no Docker socket.
# The exit sweep removes ONLY containers labelled with this run's id.
